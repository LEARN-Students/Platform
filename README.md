# Learn Student Platform

The LEARN student platform is an open-source collection of modules & resources built to empower students transitioning into a career in programming. In particular, the LEARN student platform aspires to be a comprehensive resource for learning React-on-Rails development and related topics in conjunction with the LEARN academy curriculum.

The open source nature of the project is to encourage students & alumni to build out tools and provide resources to support not only their own learning, but of their peers. This project is for LEARN students & built by LEARN students.

The LEARN student platform is still in it's infancy and we encourage you to add to the project by contributing code. To learn more about contributing please read our [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)

This project is made in conjunction with the [LEARN academy](https://www.learnacademy.org/) and is built utilizing React-on-Rails and other modern web-development technologies.
